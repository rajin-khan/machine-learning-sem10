# Research Paper Writing Guide

## General Structure of a Research Paper

### 1. Abstract
**Summary of your paper:**
- Provide a concise summary of the research.
- Define the problem and why it is important.
- Summarize the methodology and approach.
- Highlight key results and contributions.
- Conclude with the impact and significance of your findings.
- Typically written after completing the paper.

### 2. Introduction
**Defining the Problem & Motivation:**
- Clearly state the problem and its real-world relevance.
- Support with data and statistics (e.g., failure rates, inefficiencies in current systems).
- Explain the significance and potential impact of solving this problem.

**How Might We Solve This Problem?**
- Introduce the proposed solution (e.g., AI techniques, computational methods, frameworks).
- Provide a high-level overview of your approach.

**Brief Literature Review:**
- Summarize prior work related to your problem.
- Discuss methodologies used in past studies (4-5 key papers).

**Research Gap Identification:**
- Clearly outline the limitations of previous research (bullet points).
- These gaps define your research's novelty and contribution.

**Diagrams & Visuals:**
- **Preferred:** Unique diagrams explaining how your system works.
- **Alternative:** A comparison figure showing differences between conventional methods and your approach.

### 3. Literature Review
- **Topic Overview:** Summarize multiple papers covering the problem domain (4-5 papers).
- **Models & AI Techniques Used:** Discuss model selection, training, and implementation (4-5 papers).
- **Methodologies & Approaches:** Explain different methodological techniques and evaluations (4-5 papers).
- **Summary Table:**
  - Columns: Paper Title | Year | Problem Addressed | Approach | Dataset | Key Findings | Gaps Identified

### 4. Methodology
- Detailed description of how the research was conducted.
- Data collection, preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation.
- Justify why the chosen methods are appropriate.
- Include workflow diagrams, equations, and implementation steps.

### 5. Results & Experiments
- Describe the experiments conducted.
- Present performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score, precision-recall).
- Compare with baseline models or existing approaches.
- Use graphs, tables, and visualizations to support findings.

### 6. Conclusion & Future Work
- Summarize key findings.
- Discuss research limitations and challenges.
- Provide directions for future work and potential improvements.
- Highlight real-world applications of the findings.

### 7. References & Citations
- Cite all sources used in the study.
- Ensure proper referencing based on the required format (e.g., IEEE, APA, Chicago).
- Use citation managers like Zotero, Mendeley, or EndNote for proper formatting.
